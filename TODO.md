# Roadmap

This file is a catalog of planned changes, they are not listed in any particular order. New ideas will be added to the
end of the file.

* Construct a `Morphism` (name subject to change) class, to allow pullback/pushforward of tensors and forms
* Create a simpler way to handle tensor equations, possibly a way to convert LaTeX formulas involving one or more
  tensors into a single `Tensor` object
* Create a way to convert a continuous family of probability distributions into a `StatChart`
