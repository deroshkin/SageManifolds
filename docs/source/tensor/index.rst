Tensor library reference
=====================================

This library is designed for handling tensors and differential forms. See the methods for the two classes below for
type specific methods.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    tensor
    form

Additionally, this library provides 3 special methods:

.. autofunction:: Manifolds.Tensor.df

.. autofunction:: Manifolds.Tensor.laplace

.. autofunction:: Manifolds.Tensor.hessian
