Tensor library reference
=====================================

This library is designed for handling tensors and differential forms. See the methods for the two classes below for
type specific methods.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    tensor
    form

-----

Additionally, this library provides 3 special methods:

.. autofunction:: manifolds.tensor.df

.. autofunction:: manifolds.tensor.laplacian

.. autofunction:: manifolds.tensor.hessian
